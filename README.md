# lms-intrinsics: Intel Intrinsics for Lightweight Modular Staging Framework (LMS)

`lms-intrinsics` is a package that enables the use of SIMD x86 instructions in the [Lightweight Modular Staging Framework (LMS)](https://scala-lms.github.io/). While most SIMD instruction are available as a low-level machine code, the `lms-intrinsics` package focuses on the C SIMD instrinsics, which are supported by most modern C compilers such as [gcc](https://gcc.gnu.org/), [Intel Compiler](https://software.intel.com/en-us/intel-compilers), [LLVM](http://llvm.org/), etc, and provides the appropriate generation of a vectorized C code. Currently the following instruction sets are supported:


- MMX
- SSE / SSE2 / SSE3 / SSSE3 / SSE4.1 / SSE4.2
- AVX / AVX2
- FMA
- AVX-512
- KNC
- SVML

While the same set of instructions are also available on other x86 CPUs, the focus of `lms-intrinsics` is mainly towards Intel supported intrinsics, with the aim to include all listed intrinsics in the [Intel Intrinsics Guide](https://software.intel.com/sites/landingpage/IntrinsicsGuide/). Hopefully, this work will inspire the inclusion of other instruction sets and extensions such as [NEON](https://developer.arm.com/technologies/neon/intrinsics) and others in LMS. 

This implementation of `lms-intrinsics` is work done by [Ivaylo Toskov](https://github.com/ivtoskov) as part of a master thesis project at the [Department of Computer Science](https://www.inf.ethz.ch/) at [ETH Zurich](https://www.ethz.ch/en.html) Switzerland, supervised by [Alen Stojanov](https://astojanov.github.io/) and [Markus PÃ¼schel](https://www.inf.ethz.ch/personal/markusp/). 

# Usage - SBT

`lms-intrinsics` can be used though [SBT](http://www.scala-sbt.org/) directly, just include the following in your `build.sbt` file: 

```Scala
resolvers += Resolver.sonatypeRepo("snapshots")

// LMS dependency
libraryDependencies += "org.scala-lang.lms" % "lms-core_2.11" % "1.0.0-SNAPSHOT"

// support for unsigned primitives in Scala
libraryDependencies += "ch.ethz.acl" %% "scala-unsigned" % "0.1-SNAPSHOT"

// the main lms-intrinsics package
libraryDependencies += "ch.ethz.acl" %% "lms-intrinsics" % "0.0.5-SNAPSHOT"
```
If you like to use the latest version of the `lms-intrinsics` GitHub repository, add project dependency in your `Build.scala` file:

```Scala
.dependsOn(RootProject(uri("https://github.com/ivtoskov/lms-intrinsics")))
```

Note that the `lms-intrinsics` package contains the definition of more than 5000 Intel Intrinsics and other SIMD functions, therefore compilation time with Scala can be quite substantial.


# Quick Start

A minimal example of how `lms-intrinsics` can be used, can be illustrated in 3 steps:

Import LMS, the support for unsigned primitives, and import `lms-intrinsics`:

```Scala
import scala.lms.common._
import ch.ethz.acl.passera.unsigned._
import ch.ethz.acl.intrinsics._
```

Then, create an IR that spports AVX and AVX2 instructons:

``` Scala
val AVX2_IR = new BaseExp
  with ...
  with IntrinsicsBase
  with AVX
  with AVX2 { }
```  

Stage a simple function that takes two arrays of floats, a and b asarguments. Extracts the first 8 elements from the first array, adds them, and writes the result to the first 8 elements of array b:
  
```Scala  
import AVX2_IR._
def add_first_8elements(a: Rep[Array[Float]], b: Rep[Array[Float]]): Rep[Unit] = {
  val b_write = reflectMutableSym(b.asInstanceOf[Sym[Array[Float]]])
  val tmp1 = _mm256_loadu_ps(a, Const(0))
  val tmp2 = _mm256_add_ps(tmp1, tmp1)
  _mm256_storeu_ps(b_write, tmp2, Const(0))
}
```

That's it. A complete example reflecting these steps is available in the [lms-intrinsics-example](https://github.com/ivtoskov/lms-intrinsics-example) repository.
