# lms-intrinsics
Java is one of the most popular programming languages. However, the adoption of Java in some areas like high performance computing, gaming, and media processing is not as universal as in general- purpose computing. This is mainly because the Java VM, having the strong requirement for robustness, does not allow use of the low-level streaming SIMD extensions of the CPU.
The goal of this project is the introduction of explicit vectorization inside the JVM using code generation. This can be achieved by building a system using Lightweight Modular Staging (LMS) framework to generate native SIMD code. The code can then be invoked inside the JVM to obtain high performance results. While LMS is written in Scala, we believe that we can benefit from the Scala-Java interoperability to bring the SIMD instructions into the Java language.
